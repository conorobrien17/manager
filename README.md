# manager

This Django program is designed to serve as an internal business tool allowing employees to manage clients, quotes, jobs, and vehicles in a cohesive web-app. I have previously deployed a more rudimentary version of this design/project, however, the implementation--still using Django--is improved along with an increased focus on testing and expanded business requirements.
